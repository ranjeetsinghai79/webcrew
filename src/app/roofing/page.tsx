  faq: [
    ['What is a roofer virtual receptionist?', 'A roofer virtual receptionist is an AI that answers your business calls 24/7, asks each caller about the roof and damage, flags active leaks, and books inspections into your calendar. Unlike a human receptionist, it handles storm-surge call spikes without sending anyone to voicemail.'],
    ['What is an AI receptionist for roofing companies?', 'An AI receptionist for roofing companies is software that answers your business line 24/7 in a natural voice, asks each caller about the roof and the damage, flags active leaks, and books inspections into your calendar. It works like a roofer virtual receptionist without hiring a person.'],
    ['Is an AI answering service for roofers different from a call center?', 'A call center takes a message with a person reading a script. An AI answering service for roofers answers instantly, asks your intake questions every time, books the inspection when your calendar is connected, and emails you a summary of each call.'],
    ['What does it cost?', 'WebCrew is $99/month for the first 10 clients (Founding 10, price locked), then $149/month. Setup is $0 and every plan starts with a 30-day free trial. There are no overage charges: at the monthly limit, calls ring your cell instead.'],
    ['Can it handle a flood of calls right after a storm hits?', 'Yes — WebCrew answers your calls in parallel, it doesn’t queue callers or send overflow to voicemail the way a single receptionist would.'],
    ['Does it know the difference between an active leak and a routine quote?', 'Yes, once configured on your business — active-damage language gets flagged for faster follow-up, routine requests get queued normally.'],
    ['Can it ask about insurance claims?', 'Yes, that’s one of the intake questions configured during setup if that’s part of your process.'],
    ['How fast can I go live?', 'Usually within a few days. We load your services, hours and booking rules, you test-call the AI yourself, then forward your business line to it. Nothing goes live until you approve it.'],

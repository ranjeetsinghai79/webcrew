## Most leads need more than one touch

A homeowner who asked for a quote and went quiet is not necessarily a lost lead. They may be busy, waiting on a second quote, or saving up. A short, respectful follow-up brings many of them back. Most businesses never send one.

## The follow-up plan

| When | What | Channel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same day | Thank them and confirm what you understood they need | Phone or email |
| Day 3 | "Still need help with your water heater? Here is how to book." | Email (text only if they agreed to texts) |
| Day 10 | A last friendly check-in, then stop | Email |
| After a job | Appointment reminder before, review request after | Text if they agreed, else email |
| Months later | "Time for your annual tune-up?" for past customers | Email |

## Rules that keep it respectful

- **Stop as soon as they book, say no, or ask you to stop.**
- **Two follow-ups for a lead is enough.** More starts to feel like pressure.
- **Be specific.** Mention what they asked about.
- **Text only people who agreed to texts.** Email is the safe default.

## Track it

You need to know, for each lead, whether it is new, booked, won, lost, or waiting for a callback. A simple pipeline view beats a pile of sticky notes.

## Automating it

WebCrew does this out of the box:

- Every call and website chat becomes a lead card automatically.
- Leads who did not book get a follow-up on day 3 and day 10, then it stops.
- Booked customers get reminders before the visit and a review request after.
- Past customers get a friendly check-in later on.
- You get a nudge if a lead is waiting for a callback and nobody has marked it contacted.
